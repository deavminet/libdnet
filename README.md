libdnet
=======

DNET client library. This library also contains some data structures used by the server.

## Data Structures

There are two _"sets"_, persay, of data structures in the library, there are those generated by ProtocolBuffers and then which are used by the library internally. There are then the OOP data structures used by the user through the API.

The former are located in `source/libdnet/protobuf/` and the latter in `source/libdnet/api/types/`

## Todo

Below is a todo list of what needs to be done. There is a lot of work ahead and many projects that are being used to make this piece of art come to life.

- [ ] ProtocolBuffer definitions
    - [ ] Server-side encoding
        - [ ] Server-to-client
        - [ ] Server-to-server (not urgent)
    - [ ] Client-side encoding
- [ ] Encoder/Decoder functions (for the above)
- [ ] Setup eventing system
    - [ ] `tristanable` dequeue loop with hooking system into `eventy`
- [ ] Task queuing and completion with `eventy`
- [ ] Asynchronous notifications support via `eventy`
