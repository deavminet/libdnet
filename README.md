libdnet
=======

DNET client library. This library also contains some data structures used by the server.

## Data Structures

There are two _"sets"_, persay, of data structures in the library, there are those generated by ProtocolBuffers and then which are used by the library internally. There are then the OOP data structures used by the user through the API.

The former are located in `source/libdnet/protobuf/` and the latter in `source/libdnet/api/types/`
